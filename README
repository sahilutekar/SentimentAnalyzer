This repository contains a sentiment analysis project that performs sentiment analysis on Twitter data related to the Russia-Ukraine conflict. The project aims to analyze the sentiment expressed in tweets by applying the VADER sentiment analysis tool and performing text preprocessing techniques.
Dataset
The dataset used for this project is stored in a CSV file . It consists of tweets along with their associated usernames and language information. The dataset is loaded using the Pandas library, and relevant columns are selected for analysis.
Usage

    The script loads the dataset and performs the following steps:
        Selects relevant columns (username, tweet, language).
        Removes missing values from the dataset.
        Performs text preprocessing, including removing URLs, HTML tags, punctuation marks, line breaks, alphanumeric words, and stopwords. It also applies stemming to the words.
        Generates a word cloud visualization based on the cleaned tweets.
        Calculates sentiment scores (positive, negative, neutral) for each tweet using the VADER sentiment analysis tool.
        Selects the relevant columns for the final dataset.

    The updated dataset is saved to a new CSV file.

    To visualize the word cloud, sentiment analysis results, and access the updated dataset, refer to the generated CSV file.
